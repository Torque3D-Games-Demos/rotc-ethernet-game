    - Orange/green projectiles bypass the health buffer.
    - Red/blue projectiles bypass the barrier.
    - The barrier is only activated when a CAT was hit by
      an orange/green projectile.
    - When a CAT's barrier has been activated, the CAT is not
      affected by orange/green projectiles until the barrier
      has completely faded away.

Prototype 3-testing
-------------------

Released: Apr. 26, 2011

- Breaks backwards compatibility to older versions!
- Somewhat improved performance (still requires way too 
  much horsepower for the way it looks).

  but unlike before, damaging enemies' damage buffers 
  does not count. In addition, overflowing damage buffers
  leak very fast in CAT form.  
- Players now have three equipment slots instead of two.
- The etherboard now takes up an equipment slot.
- New "Regenerate" ability: Takes up one (or more for increased
  effect) equipment slots but constantly heals the player while
  in CAT form.
- The weapons' now impart a lot more force when they hit.
  To compensate for this, CATs can become "connected" to the
  ground by being close to it and not etherboarding. When
  fully connected,  the impact force from a hit is reduced by 75%.
- B.O.U.N.C.E. now also deals damage based on the speed of the bounced enemy.
- Weapon changes:
   - Blaster:
      - Now requires at least 4 of the 9 shots to hit in order 
        to get a disc lock.

      - Projectiles now bounce off surfaces.

   - "Snap To Grid" and "Rotation Snap"
   - Moved most useful options from the "World Editor Setting" into
     separate "World Editor Toolbox".
- Bugfixes & all kinds of minor improvements.

  counting discs, grenades and B.O.U.N.C.E.).
