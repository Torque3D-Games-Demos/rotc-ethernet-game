Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet p.5-testing
=========================================

Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet is an independent experimental multiplayer FPS game.

Visit http://ethernet.wasted.ch for more information.

This is a testing release of prototype 5 of the game. The idea of a testing
release is to publish something useable that doesn't seem to have *major* bugs
in order to find and fix minor bugs.

Just like with the previous prototypes, don't expect any fancy graphics or great maps.

Known Issues
------------

- The game is still not very optimized in terms of speed, but the Linux version
  seems to run incredibly slow on systems with ATI graphics drivers (to the
  point where it's unplayable).
