Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet p.2-testing
=========================================

Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet wants to be a fast-paced, teamwork-
oriented, non-stop-action multiplayer FPS game that allows players to
achieve a high degree of mastery.

Its main influences are:
- Subspace/Continuum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubSpace_%28video_game%29)
- Starsiege: Tribes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsiege_Tribes)
- Tron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_%28film%29)
 
This is a testing version of prototype 2 of the game. It has only been
tested quickly by a few people. There shouldn't be any *major* bugs, but who 
knows? - That's why the "testing" designation is there.
Just like with the 1.x prototypes, don't expect any fancy graphics or great maps.

Known Issues
------------

- As of Mar. 5, 2011, the main master server is still down. That's why this
  version has support for a backup master server. If the backup master server
  is down as well, you can use the in-game "Player Chat" to find servers.

- The game is still not very optimized in terms of speed, but the Linux version
  seems to run incredibly slow on systems with ATI graphics drivers (to the
  point where it's unplayable).
