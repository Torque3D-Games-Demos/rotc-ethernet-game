Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet Prototype 1.11
============================================

Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet wants to be a fast-paced, teamwork-
oriented, non-stop-action multiplayer FPS game that allows players to
achieve a high degree of mastery.

Its main influences are:
- Subspace/Continuum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubSpace_%28video_game%29)
- Starsiege: Tribes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsiege_Tribes)
- Tron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_%28film%29)
 
This is Prototype 1.11 of the game. The primary purpose of the 1.x
prototypes is to test and experiment with the core gameplay mechanics,
so don't expect any fancy graphics or great maps.
