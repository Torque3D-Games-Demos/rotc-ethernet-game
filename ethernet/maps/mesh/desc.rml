Mesh is a smallish but yet complex map for 2 or more players. It consists of five rooms which are connected by corridors - but not all of them are passable all the time. By a timer it is decided which corridors are passable, so the shape of the map changes all the time.
This demands fast reaction and tactical thinking of all players and fully underlines what it means for rotc ethernet to be a fast paced game.
