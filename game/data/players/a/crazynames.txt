Perhaps you're wondering: "What's with the nonsensical directory names here?"
The answer is simple: The names are kept short because they need to be sent over
the 'net for every animation each directory contains (which is a lot).

Here are the real names:
a	arms
fb	full body
nm	no *.max files
tl	torso and legs
ub	upper body
