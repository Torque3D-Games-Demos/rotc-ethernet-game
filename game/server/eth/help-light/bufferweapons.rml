Fundamentally there are two categories of weapons in ROTC: Those that bypass a CAT's barrier (colored red/blue) and those that bypass a CAT's health buffer (colored orange/green).

In Ethernet Light there are no weapons in the latter category, thus multiple hits in quick succession will often be required to do a respectable amount of permanent damage to an enemy CAT.

There is also no way to customize your CATs loadout in Ethernet Light: All CATs carry a Blaster and a Battle Rifle.
