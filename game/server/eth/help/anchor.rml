<lmargin:5>All CATs are equipped with an anchor module. To compensate for the strong push from being hit by a projectile, the anchor module can "anchor" a CAT to the ground. When fully anchored,  the impact force from a hit is reduced by 75%. Not touching the ground or using the <a:cmd Manual 8.1>Etherboard</a> will cause a CAT to slowly lose anchoring.
