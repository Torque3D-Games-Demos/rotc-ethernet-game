CATs are equipped with a Chrestmann-Goldberg device that can be used to reverse the momentum of nearby enemy CATs. This is commonly called firing a B.O.U.N.C.E. (Burst Of Ultraons eNgaging Close Enemies). Pressing @bind51 activates the burst. If no enemy CATs are close this process drains 50% of the CAT's armor. Because it uses an enemy CAT's momentum against it, a B.O.U.N.C.E. is most effective against fast-moving CATs.
