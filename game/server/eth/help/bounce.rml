<lmargin:5>All CATs are equipped with a Chrestmann-Goldberg device that can be used to reverse the momentum of nearby enemy CATs. This is commonly called firing a B.O.U.N.C.E. (Burst Of Ultraons eNgaging Close Enemies). 

Pressing @bind51 activates the burst. If no enemy CATs are close this process drains 50% of the CAT's energy.

If enemy CATs are close, their momentum will be reversed and they will take some damage depending on how fast they were going. The burst will also activate their <a:cmd Manual 4.3>barrier</a>, making them immune to immediate follow-up bursts.

Because it uses an enemy CAT's momentum against it, a B.O.U.N.C.E. is most effective against fast-moving CATs.
