All CATs are equipped with a damper. The damper is a CAT's first line of protection. It absorbs up to 50% damage if the CAT has 100% energy. The damage absorbed by the damper decreases in a linear fashion with decreased energy levels.

Or to put it another way: The less energy you have, the more damage you take. So spend your energy wisely.
