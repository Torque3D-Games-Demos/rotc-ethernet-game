<lmargin:5>The Mine Launcher can fire up to four mines in quick succession.
Firing it doesn't drain energy but instead draws from the same ammo source as the <a:cmd Manual 6.4>grenades</a>. Once in position, the mines work like a <a:cmd Manual 7.2>B.O.U.N.C.E.</a> that's triggered by nearby moving enemies. If not triggered by an enemy, the mine will trigger after a few seconds. CATs with an active <a:cmd Manual 4.3>barrier</a> will not trigger the mines.
