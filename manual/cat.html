	<h1>Life as CAT</h1>
	
	<p>
	<i>CATs</i> are the physical manifestations of the <i>Reds</i> and <i>Blues</i> that can capture
	zones, tag enemies, shoot and be destroyed.<br/>
	The <i>Reds</i> and <i>Blues</i> have the following basic properties:
	<ul>
		<li>Health: 75</li>
		<li>Health buffer: 25</li>
		<li>Energy: 100</li>				
	</ul>
	In addition, every <i>CAT</i> has energy-based armor, an <i>Etherboard</i>, 
	two <a href="weapons.html#disc"><i>Discs</i></a>,
	<a href="weapons.html#grenade"><i>Grenades</i></a>,
	the <a href="weapons.html#trident"><i>Trident</i></a> 
	and the primary weapon that was selected while in <i>Etherform</i>.

	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>	
	Players start with 75 health points. At least 25% health is needed to manifest as a <i>CAT</i>.
	Health is lost if a player takes more damage than the <i>health buffer</i> can absorb.
	To regain health, players can either change back into <i>Etherform</i> and rest in a zone
	owned by their team or inflict damage on an enemy <i>CAT</i>. If you damage another <i>CAT</i>,
	50% of the inflicted damage is returned to you first as health and then put into your <i>health buffer</i>,
	possibly overflowing it.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Health buffer</h2>
	<p>	
	Players have a health buffer that constantly re-/degenerates to 25 points. Damage first hits the 
	<i>health buffer</i> before affecting a player's health. The <i>health buffer</i> can overflow
	if players inflict enough damage on enemies.
	</p>		

	<h2>Energy</h2>
	<p>	
	A <i>CAT</i> needs energy to power its armor and fire its weapons.
	The energy consumed when firing a shot from a weapon is restored if the shot hits an enemy.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Armor</h2>
	<p>	
	Every <i>CAT</i> has energy-based armor that can absorb up to 50% damage if the <i>CAT</i>
	has full energy. The damage absorbed by the armor decreases in a linear fashion with
	decreased energy.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Etherboard</h2>
	<p>	
	By holding down the <b>left control</b> key, <i>CATs</i> can trade agility for speed by  
	using the <i>Etherboard</i> to ride the ether.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Tagging</h2>
	<p>
	Players are tagged when they take damage from an enemy.
	Tagged enemies appear on the HUD.
	</p>	

	<h2>Returning to Etherform</h2>
	<p>	
	By pressing <b>TAB</b>, players manifested as <i>CAT</i> can dissolve their physical bodies at any time.
