	<h1>Life as Etherform</h1>
	
	<p>
	After joining a team, players spawn as <i>Etherform</i>. <i>Etherforms</i> can move freely around the map, but can't 
	pass through solid objects.
	As <i>Etherform</i>, players can select their primary weapon, move quickly from zone to zone and manifest as <i>CAT</i> anywhere within
	their team's zones. In addition, players regenerate their health while they are in <i>Etherform</i> in a zone that's owned by
	their team.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<h2>Manifesting as CAT</h2>	
	In order to get anything done, players need to change from <i>Etherform</i> into <i>CAT</i> form.
	<b>This is done by pressing TAB</b> while being inside a zone that's owned by the player's team.
	Manifesting as <i>CAT</i> requires at least 25% health and 50% energy.
