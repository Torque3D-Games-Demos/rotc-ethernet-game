	<h1>Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet - Intro</h1>
	
	<p>
	Welcome to <i>Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet</i>, or just <i>Ethernet</i> for short. 
	<i>Ethernet</i> aims to be a fast-paced, teamwork-oriented, non-stop-action multiplayer FPS
	game combining elements from games such as <i>Starsiege: Tribes</i> and <i>Subspace/Continuum</i>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This is <b>Prototype 1.9.1</b> of <i>Ethernet</i>. The primary purpose of the 1.x prototypes is to test
	and experiment with the core gameplay mechanics, so don't expect any fancy graphics or great maps.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This manual assumes that the player has more than just passing experience with multiplayer first person 
	shooter games. If you've never played an FPS, <i>Ethernet</i> (and especially this not-so-user-friendly
	prototype) is probably not the best game to start with. Even if you have a lot of experience with games
	of this kind, you might be thrown off by stuff like:
	<ul>
		<li>
		Players can't really die, if they take enough damage, they simply lose their physical manifestation,
		which is something they can also do voluntarily.
		</li>	
		<li>
		Players have energy that constantly regenerates. Energy is both used to fire weapons as well as
		powering the player's shield. While the energy used to fire a shot is restored if the shot
		hits an enemy, missing an enemy leaves the player with a decreased energy level and thus
		lowered shields which make him more vulnerable to damage.
		</li>
		<li>
		Players have a "damage buffer" which constantly regenerates. If a player has full energy, weaker
		weapons don't do enough damage with a single hit to cause "permanent" damage.
		</li>
		<li>
		Apropos "permanent" damage: There are no health kits. Health is primarily restored by inflicting
		damage to enemies: If a player inflicts damage on another player, health lost by the victim is transferred
		to the attacker, if the attacker already has full health, the excess health "overflows" the player's
		damage buffer, giving him more than 100% health until all the excess health has been removed by damage
		or has slowly "leaked" away.
		</li>
		
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In <i>Ethernet</i>, every map is divided into different zones and two teams of ethereal beings
	("Reds" and "Blues") fight over control of these zones. Players can exist in two different forms: The freely moving,
	indestructible <i>"Etherform"</i> and a humanoid, weapon-wielding physical manifestation called
	a <i>"CAT"</i>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Players start out in <i>Etherform</i> and need to find a zone owned by their team in order
	to manifest as a <i>CAT</i>. As <i>CAT</i>, players take zones for their team simply by
	being inside the zone while no enemy <i>CAT</i> is also present in the zone. The zone then turns
	red or blue, depending on which team captured it. If <i>CATs</i> of	both teams are present,
	the zone remains white.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The game is won if the opposing team has lost all their zones and has no more players 
	manifested as <i>CATs</i>.
