	New players are put into observer mode. In this mode, players are completely invisible
	and are able to move absolutely freely around the map. You can increase your movement speed
	by pressing down the left mouse button, pressing down the right mouse button or - for maximum
	speed - pressing down both the left and the right mouse button.
