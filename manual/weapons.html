	Every <i>CAT</i> carries a head-mounted disc launcher and two discs.

	<h3>Seeking Disc</h3>
	<table><tr><td id="noborder" valign="top">	
	<table align="left">
		<tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_disc.png"></td></tr>
	</table>		
	A seeker <i>Disc</i> will track its target until it has hit it, missed it, was deflected by another <i>Disc</i>,
	has bounced a few times or has expired.	While a disc does not deal a lot of damage compared to its rate of fire, it uses
	absolutely no energy and will return 20 points of energy to the CAT that launched it when it hits its target.
	To throw a disc, you first need to get a target-lock on an enemy <i>CAT</i>. The seeker is then thrown by a quick click of
	the right mouse button. These are the rules to get a target lock:<br/>
	- Hit the target with a seeker <i>Disc</i><br/>
	- Damage the target with a <i>Grenade</i><br/>
	- Hit the target with at least 3 of the 9 shots fired by the <i>Trident</i><br/>
	- Land a direct hit on the target with the <i>MG</i><br/>
	A target-lock lasts for two seconds. Also note that a CAT can only be attacked by one disc at a time.

	To deflect an incoming seeker <i>Disc</i>, keep the crosshair over it until it's locked, then press the right mouse button.	
	For deflecting a disc, CATs are rewarded with a three second grace period, during which they can not be attacked by another disc.

	<table><tr><td id="noborder" valign="top">
	<table align="left"><tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_grenade.png"></td></tr></table>
	A grenade will implode shortly after it has been thrown.
	To throw a grenade you need to hold down and then release the middle mouse button.
	The grenade is thrown farther the longer the mouse button was held down. 
	There's also the possibility to throw a Grenade	instantly at full force by holding
	down shift and clicking the middle mouse button.
	Grenades don't consume energy. Instead, they draw from their own separate ammo supply.
	The grenade ammo supply regenerates slowly by itself, but the regeneration can be sped
	up by dealing damage to enemies.

	Every <i>CAT</i> carries a <i>Trident</i>.
	The <i>Trident</i> is a powerful but tricky weapon. It always fires 9 shots at once.
	Because of this, it uses a lot of energy and has a huge recoil, but is able to deal up
	to 90 points of damage at once. The properties of an individual <i>Trident</i> shot:

	<table><tr><td id="noborder" valign="top">

		<tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_assaultrifle.png"></td></tr>
	</table>	
	The <i>MG</i> fires tiny grenades that explode near enemies or on impact.
	While a single grenade is pretty weak, the fact that you don't have to be 100% 
	accurate to deal damage to enemies combined with a relatively high rate of 
	fire turn the <i>MG</i> into a formidable weapon.

	The <i>Sniper ROFL</i> is... kind of a sniper rifle.
	The sniper rofl needs to be charged before it can fire. While charging doesn't take long and
	doesn't consume energy, you can't run fast or use the Etherboard while doing it.
	Hold down the left mouse button to charge, release it to fire.
