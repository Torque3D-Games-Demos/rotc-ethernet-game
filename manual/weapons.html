	<h2><a name="sceptre"></a>The Crystal Sceptre</h2>
	<p>		
	Every <i>CAT</i> carries two <i>Crystal Sceptres</i>. 
	The <i>Sceptre</i> has three different modes that are accessed via the right and middle mouse buttons.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Exploding Sceptre</h3>
	<table><tr><td id="noborder" valign="top">
	<table align="left"><tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_grenade.png"></td></tr></table>
	An exploding <i>Sceptre</i> will explode shortly after it has been thrown.
	To throw an exploding <i>Sceptre</i> you need to hold down the right mouse button.
	After a little while you will hear a first click, which indicates
	that the <i>Sceptre</i> can be thrown by releasing the mouse button. The <i>Sceptre</i> is thrown farther
	the longer the mouse button was held down. There's also the possibility to throw an exploding <i>Sceptre</i>
	instantly at full force by holding down shift and clicking the right mouse button.

	<h3>Seeking Sceptre</h3>
	<table><tr><td id="noborder" valign="top">	
	<table align="left">
		<tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_disc.png"></td></tr>
	</table>		
	A seeker <i>Sceptre</i> will track its target until it has hit it, was deflected by another <i>Sceptre</i>,
	has bounced a few times or has expired.	While a seeker does not deal a lot of damage compared to its rate of fire, it uses
	absolutely no energy and can suck up to 20 points of energy from its target and transfer them to the CAT that threw the <i>Sceptre</i>.
	To throw a seeker, you first need to get a target-lock on an enemy <i>CAT</i>. The seeker is then thrown by a quick click of
	the right mouse button. These are the rules to get a target lock:<br/>
	- Hit the target with a seeker <i>Sceptre</i><br/>
	- Damage the target with an exploding <i>Sceptre</i><br/>
	- Hit the target with at least 3 of the 9 shots fired by the <i>Trident</i><br/>
	- Land a direct hit on the target with the <i>MG</i><br/>
	A target-lock lasts for two seconds.

	To deflect an incoming seeker <i>Sceptre</i>, keep the crosshair over it until it's locked, then press the middle mouse button.

	<table align="left">
		<tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_blaster.png"></td></tr>
	</table>	
	Every <i>CAT</i> carries a <i>Trident</i>.
	The <i>Trident</i> is a powerful but tricky weapon. It always fires 9 shots at once.
	Because of this, it uses a lot of energy and has a huge recoil, but is able to deal up
	to 135 damage at once. The properties of an individual <i>Trident</i> shot:

	<h2><a name="mg"></a>The Micro-Grenade Launcher AKA The MG</h2>
	<table><tr><td id="noborder" valign="top">		
	<table align="left">
		<tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_assaultrifle.png"></td></tr>
	</table>	
	The <i>MG</i> fires tiny grenades that explode near enemies or on impact.
	The grenades need a moment to arm themselves after leaving the barrel, making the <i>MG</i>
	a sub-optimal choice if the enemy is really close. While a single grenade is pretty weak,
	the fact that you don't have to be 100% accurate to deal damage to enemies combined with
	a relatively high rate of fire turn the <i>MG</i> into a formidable weapon.

	<h2><a name="hyper"></a>The Hyper-Missile Launcher AKA The Hyperrifle</h2>
	<table><tr><td id="noborder" valign="top">		
	<table align="left">
		<tr><td><img src="./graphics/wpn_sniperrifle.png"></td></tr>
	</table>	
	The <i>Hyperrifle</i> is a missile launcher in the form of a rifle. The guided missile fired
	by the <i>Hyperrifle</i> leaves brightly colored sparks on its path and weird colorful (but harmless) effects in the ether near enemies.
	In order to fire the <i>Hyperrifle</i> you first need to get a lock on a target for the missile.
	To select a target, hold down the left mouse button while the crosshair
	is over an enemy <i>CAT</i>, keep the crosshair on the target until it's locked
	as target, then release the button to fire.
	Note that the <i>Hyperrifle</i> needs at least 40 energy to be even able to search for a target
	and that the targeting process itself already uses up your energy.	
	Also, keep in mind that the missile is not that agile. If you're close to your enemy, your aim 
	needs to be more accurate than when you're standing far away and the missile has more
	time to home in on its target.
